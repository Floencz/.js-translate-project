                    "question": "Can I receive Speakingathome's lessons from my phone or Tablet?",
                    "answer": "This depends on whether your smartphone or tablet permits this, although normally any next generation mobile enables videoconferencing for Skype without any problem. It is important, in this case, that the Internet you use is high quality, and that you're in a place where noise will not impede your teacher's ability to listen to you."

                    "question": "Can I receive the audio from my lessons in mp3 format, after each lesson?",
                    "answer": "Yes, although our Academy rules state that you have to remind your teacher at the beginning of the lesson. Recording is an additional service that is subject to technical or human error in the recording. Because of this, this service is not mandatory, so you are not able to not claim the mp3 or the return of credit should there be any problem with this service. When the class is finished, you will have to provide a means for the transfer of the file. We accept only WeTransfer or Dropbox."

                    "question": "Is the use of headphones mandatory?",
                    "answer": "It is not obligatory, but it is highly recommended to make the most of your lesson. By using headphones, you avoid external noises and loss of concentration, you can hear your teacher much better, and also contribute much more to the quality of your lesson's mp3 recording. Therefore, Speakingathome strongly recommends the use of headphones."
                },
                {
                    "question": "What steps can I take to optimise the quality of video conferencing?",
                    "answer": "Skype is one of the leading videoconferencing systems worldwide and its video conferencing often provides optimum quality. If you notice that the lesson is problematic in the quality of the video or audio, please check that there is no software, such as EMule, BitTorrent, etc. downloading files. These programs use a considerable bandwidth, leaving little bandwidth for the correct use of Skype video conferencing. If despite shutting down this type of program, you are still having problems with your connection, you can choose to turn off the video for Skype and attend the lesson in audio mode only. This will decrease the need for bandwidth of Skype."

                    "question": "Can you issue an invoice of my purchase?",
